Substitute the NA values for the engine, power, and mileage with the median
The best substitute method is the median since it prevents outliers and maintains the center tendency.
Change the Seat NA settings to Mode. Despite being a quantitative value, the number of seats is discontinuous, hence the mode is employed.

It is preferable to remove a column in the instance of Newprice since there are a lot of null values there. Imputing any values could generate outliers in the data and incorrect analysis.
